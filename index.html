    <h1>IST-264 Prototyping and Usability Project
    <h2>Redesigning a Planner app </h2>
    <!--Hw1-->

    <h3>Our Team</h3>
    <p>Mercury Bao and Danielle Smith</p>

    <h3>Who's the Customer?</h3>
    <p>People who use a planner like students, teachers, or those who like to maintain
        organization in their lives.
    </p>
    <h3>The Problem </h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>There are all kinds of users with different habits, so we'll have satisfy a majority 
            of them but unfortunately won't be able to get all of them.</li><br>
            <li>The two main types of people we can classify being exposed to this app are people who love 
            to plan and people who hate to plan.</li><br>
            <li>Another pain point is that there are too many planner 
            apps so we'll have to make ours stand out from the rest of them.</li><br>
            <li>People often find
            planner apps annoying or forget to use them so we'll need to come up with a way to 
            keep users engaged with our app and keep using it to help organize their lives.</li><br>
            <li>Not all planer apps are built the same, they each have their own advantages and 
            disadvantages, so ideally it would be best to take some of the best features of them
            and include them in our app.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Our Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        <uL>
            <li>One aspect of this prototype is to be able to show how to create new events 
                and tasks for your schedule and how to modify or delete existing ones.</li><br>
            <li>Another aspect of this prototype is showing how to create tasks and the ability
                to check them off when you complete them.</li><br>
            <li>The overall goal is to help keep people organized if they decide to use this app
                and like it as opposed to using something else.</li>
        </uL>

    <h2>Lo-fi Prototypes</h2>
    <p>
        Here is a link to our lo-fi version of our planner app in both desktop and mobile form.
        We created it using Figma and since it's lo-fidelity, focued on just the layout and navigation.
        <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/92vsi3YWk7UWMoAP1Rx6IP/ISTE264-hw2-team4?node-id=0%3A1">Figma Link</a>

    <h2>Evaluation of our lo-fi prototypes</h2>
    <p>
        We tested a few people we knew on our lo-fi prototpye to see what they thought of it.
        Overall, it seems like that our prototype needs some work in terms of interaction and making 
        things less cluttered and more simplified on the page.<br><br>The feedback that I got from the 
        two participants that I tested specifically had somewhat similar feedback though worded differently.
        I had them both look at our desktop version first and then the mobile version and allowed them to 
        explore what was going on for a few minutes on their own without any prompt. Afterwards, I then asked 
        them what were their thoughts on both versions and encourage to make suggestions on how they would like 
        to see features layed out and took notes on and documented them.<br><br> Both of these participants are 
        familiar with tehcnology and it was interesting to see that one participant preferred the desktop version 
        while the other one preferred the mobile version. I thought that the feedback we got from our participants 
        was valueable since it allows us to see where our flaws are and start to think of ideas of how to fix them 
        when we make our hi-fi prototype. I definitely think that once we apply these suggestions, it will feel more 
        like a version that can be used rather than some broken screens which is what they feel like at the moment due 
        to no interaction between them for both versions.
