    <h1>IST-264 Prototyping and Usability Project
    <h2>Redesigning a Planner app </h2>

    <h3>Our Team</h3>
    <p>Mercury Bao and Danielle Smith</p>

    <h3>Who's the Customer?</h3>
    <p>People who use a planner like students, teachers, or those who like to maintain
        organization in their lives.
    </p>
    <h3>The Problem </h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>There are all kinds of users with different habits, so we'll have satisfy a majority 
            of them but unfortunately won't be able to get all of them.</li><br>
            <li>The two main types of people we can classify being exposed to this app are people who love 
            to plan and people who hate to plan.</li><br>
            <li>Another pain point is that there are too many planner 
            apps so we'll have to make ours stand out from the rest of them.</li><br>
            <li>People often find
            planner apps annoying or forget to use them so we'll need to come up with a way to 
            keep users engaged with our app and keep using it to help organize their lives.</li><br>
            <li>Not all planer apps are built the same, they each have their own advantages and 
            disadvantages, so ideally it would be best to take some of the best features of them
            and include them in our app.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Our Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        <uL>
            <li>One aspect of this prototype is to be able to show how to create new events 
                and tasks for your schedule and how to modify or delete existing ones.</li><br>
            <li>Another aspect of this prototype is showing how to create tasks and the ability
                to check them off when you complete them.</li><br>
            <li>The overall goal is to help keep people organized if they decide to use this app
                and like it as opposed to using something else.</li>
        </uL>
